## `npm i ultra`

### Quick Intro

Imagine we're tasked to setup routes for a news portal startup. We'll use a rudimentary  navigation structure for the purpose of this exercise.

```AsciiDoc
                +----------+
     +----------+   root   +---------+
     |          +----------+         |
     |                               |
     |                               |
+----+-----+                   +-----+----+
| weather  |                 +-+   news   +-+
+----------+                 | +----------+ |
                             |              |
                        +----+-----+  +-----+----+
                        | politics |  |  sports  |
                        +----------+  +----------+
```


- Code to setup centralized routing (matching and resolution) as shown below

```javascript

import { spec, match, prefixMatch, container } from 'ultra'

let next = console.log.bind(console), err = console.warn.bind(console)

// when route resolves call next on exact match, err on partial match
// log route result to the console (warn on partial match)

let matchers = [
  match(spec('/weather')(next)), //a
  prefixMatch('/news', match(spec('/', '/politics', '/sports')(next, err))), //b
  match(spec('/')(next)) //c
]

```

- Integrate with browser's PushState API to kickoff routing

```javascript

let ultra = container(matchers) // run

// use ultra to navigate
ultra.push('/news') // resolve: b.next
ultra.push('/news/sports') // resolve: b.next
ultra.push('/news/foo') // resolve: b.err
```
- Treat query string and hash fragments integral to routing

```JavaScript
import { check, parseQS, prependPath } from 'ultra'

// add :zip identifier to our path key
let weatherSpec = spec('/weather','/weather/:zip')(next, err)

// validate value of identifier with check
let zipCheck = check(':zip')(/^[0-9]{5}$/) //allow 5 digits

// extract loc value from query string and append to path
let addZip = ({qs, path}) => qs ? prependPath(parseQS(qs, ['loc']), path) : path

let weatherMatch = match(weatherSpec, zipCheck, addZip) //a*

// clone container: replace match (a -> a*), replace current instance
ultra = container([weatherMatch, ...ultra.matchers.slice(1)], null, ultra)

// navigate
ultra.push('/weather') //resolve: a*.next

// assume query param loc is set externally
ultra.push('/weather?loc=90210') //resolve: a*.next with :zip = 90210
ultra.push('/weather?loc=abc') //resolve: a*.err
```

> âœ… Routing code is reused in these examples. Generally a good measure to suggest that the abstraction hit a sweet spot!

This is true, in part because component-based design afforded us this level of  flexibility: choosing how micro or macro you want your module to be.

> We're often not seeking for more power. We're seeking for more principled ways of using our existing power.

Quote from one of my favorite React talks by Cheng Lou: [The Spectrum of Abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVVNJKv9esE) _#throwback_

### USP
- Embrace component paradigm, stay framework agnostic
  - Use conventions to map url string to component (sub)trees
  - Independent of rendering or view layer
    - Immune to complexity introduced by framework-level abstractions (context in React for e.g.)
- Extensible
  - Composable API provides clear separation between route configuration and runtime to avail maximum reuse and target different environments
- Compact
  - Ideal for mobile and progressive web apps
    - No runtime dependencies
    - 5k > ultra (> preact)
    - Code splitting friendly

### Trade-offs
  - For modern browsers with pushstate support
  - Does not render component or fetch data
  - Relies on use of path keys (strings) to derive result
    - More complex update process involves replacing path keys throughout the app
    - Path keys (non-minified) may contribute to bloated bundles
      - Concern for apps with _multiple_ deeply nested routes, e.g. Amazon
  - For the Developer: Overcome the notion of changing your routing code again this season, and actually following through. No pun intended.
