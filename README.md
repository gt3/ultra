  - Independent of rendering or view layer
- Compliments component-based architecture
  - Use convention over configuration
- Extensible and Compact
  - Clear seperation between configuration and runtime
  - Does not render component or fetch data for you (it's a good thing)
  - For modern browsers with ES6 support
  - Functional routing API to target different environments
