### Benefits
- Embrace component paradigm, stay framework agnostic
  - Use conventions to map url string to component (sub)trees
  - Independent of rendering or view layer
    - Routing should be immune to complexity introduced by framework-level abstractions (context in React for e.g.)
- Co-locate routes to support scalability
  - Routes are data. Similar types of information are best understood if they exist in the same space.
  - On the other end, as relationships between components get more complex, it is best to leave route matching logic out of the mix.
- Extensible
  - Composable API provides clear separation between route configuration and runtime to avail maximum reuse and target different environments
- Compact
  - Ideal for mobile/progressive web apps
    - No runtime dependencies
    - `4.6 kb > ultra (> preact)`
    - Code splitting friendly

### Trade-offs
  - For modern browsers with pushstate support
  - Does not render component or fetch data
  - Relies on use of path keys (strings) to derive result
    - More complex update process involves replacing path keys throughout the app
    - Path keys (non-minified) may contribute to bloated bundles
      - Concern for apps with _multiple_ deeply nested routes, e.g. Amazon
  - For the Developer: Overcome the notion of changing your routing code again this season, and actually following through. No pun intended.
